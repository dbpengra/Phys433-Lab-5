    "The tasks for this experiment's analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prior to working on this noetbook, obtain the peak positions of the main photopeaks in the calibration data sets and the positions and full-width at half maxima of the photopeaks in the Compton scattering data.  Also obtain the integrated area of the photopeaks for the Compton scattering cross section data sets.  Then create these arrays:\n",
    "   * Energy vs. photopeak position for the calibration data.\n",
    "   * Scattering angle vs. peak position for the Compton scattering data.\n",
    "   * Plastic thickness vs. photopeak area (net counts) for the cross section data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a line fit to the calibration data to convert channel number to energy in MeV.  Save the calibration coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a function that will give the predicted channel number as a function of angle for the Compton-scattered photopeaks.  Then plot this prediction along with the measured photopeak positions (in channel numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Convert the photopeak positions and FWHM for the Compton scattering data to energy units, using the calibration coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a fitting function, based on the expected energy vs. angle, for Compton scattering.  There should be one fit parameter: the incident energy of the gamma ray.  Use this function in the LMFIT `Model` to carry out a fit of the theoretical formula to the data.  Compare the fitted incident energy to the known incident energy from the Cs-137 source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For the total scattering cross section, plot the photopeak net area (i.e., integrated counts) versus plastic thickness (in cm) on a single-log axis (vertical).  Fit this data set (either with a line to the log of the counts, or with an exponential decay to the counts) to obtain the gamma-attenuation coeffient $\\mu$ (in cm<sup>-1</sup>) for Lucite plastic.  Then calculate the scattering cross-section per electron by means of the chemical data for Lucite (i.e., divide out the number of electrons per cm<sup>3</sup>).  "
